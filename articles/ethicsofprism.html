<h2>The Ethics of PRISM</h2>
<blockquote>All silencing of discussion is an admission of infalibility, (Mill, On Liberty, p77)</blockquote><br/>
<p>Many nation states have passed extensive data retention laws. Rumors of covert intelligence gathering on a massive scale, and subsequent revelations of the same have surfaced in varying degrees since the dawn of the age of information The web of surveillance we have become entangled within, willingly or un-willingly, brings to the forefront two important questions of the ethics of information.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Should states and super state organizations be permitted to collect all signal intelligence from public and private technological infrastructure.</li>
  
  <li>Do we, as citizens of the age of information, have a right to privacy and anonymity.</li>
</ol>

<p>I will render a short defense of 2. by presenting a short utilitarian argument.</p>

<p>An answer in the affirmative to both of these questions is contradictory, from a utilitarian position. To enumerate but a few of the surveillance operations we have in mind as we consider the first question; PRISM<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>, Room 47A<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>, The EU Data Retention Directive, The French Surveillance. The important quantifier here is "all". Chosen, because it is the stated goal, the endgame, the most desired outcome by those currently doing the surveillance. In order not to contradict the affirmative of the second question, the scope of such operations must be limited. It is important to have in mind, that we are not only dealing with the collection of personal information by say, hospitals, insurance agencies and the tax-office. The assimilation and storage of <emp>all</emp> communication to the extend technologically possible is the agenda<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3. </p></a></sup>

<p>The most common argument for extensive surveillance that infringes on the rights to anonymity and privacy is an appeal to utility. Better effectiveness in the war on terror. Empirical data in support of this argument, or similar ones, is problematic. It would not be in the interest of states to disclose detailed information about plots stopped, if any. We could enumerate those that were <emp>not</emp> stopped. Further is this problematic since continued failure is used as justification for furthering and widening the information gathering. We haven't uncovered any plots because we don't have enough data. Infinite utility regress. Where no solid empirical evidence can be presented and another appeal to utility for why this is so and for discarding any arguments for utility on the opposite side.</p>

<p>What is then the argument from utility for the rights to privacy and anonymity? Serving as my guideline is the utilitarianism of J.S Mill. What the argument above fails to do in order to be properly utilitarian is the evaluation of utility against the totality of history, past and possible future, as well as neglecting its experimental nature. Both aspects of which are anchors of many of Mills texts. The right to free speech is defended by virtue of it being the only reasonable guarantee of continued progress. Only the open debate, and free exchange of ideas an hinder a society becoming stagnant, or worse, declining into tyranny. We look at our histories and see it is in our nature to err. At no point can we imagine no need for further progress in the realm of ideas or expression. It seems probable for this to continue to be the case, and as such it would be an unwelcome hindrance to restrict the freedom of communication. If it can be shown that 1. in its most radical sense is a limitation on the right to free speech and expression, we will have arrived at the crux of the matter.</p>

<p>We could take a look at the Saudi governments desire to eavesdrop on its citizens communication by their contacting Moxy Marlinspike<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup>, a prominent researcher on the security protocols used among other places in web traffic. The timing of the request coincides of course with popular uprisings in the country. If governments out of favor with their citizens can monitor all online activities, the organization of many of the demonstrations of the Arab Spring would not have taken place. It would have become easier to identify and arrest core activists. If the only arena for debate and expression available is the one provided by your Internet connection it becomes hard to argue that its continued openness is not pivotal in maintaining freedom of speech, and as such not hindering the growth of the human soul. A tactic employed by rouge states against its citizens is hard to defend as a safeguard for its the same in allegedly more democratic states. The extent of the right to privacy considered is such that it includes within it the right to anonymity. If restrictions are enforced on the availability of anonymity protocols such as Tor, then a limitation is placed on a venue for speech where non else are available.</p>

<p>The argument for the utility of the sphere of digital liberties including the rights of anonymity and privacy holds in regards to its utility, as it hinges on the same basic principle as Mill defends freedom of the press and of though and opinion. If one denies that its from the these wells we tap the waters of progress or that progress is not when taken as a whole, of greatest worth, then the argument falls. Such is an utilitarian argument for these rights. I take the former position that continued progress remains in the good of all, and that freedom of speech and expression are its foundation.</p>
