<h2>The ethics of PRISM</h2>

  The (not so surprising) revelation of the extent of surveilance conduction by the USA carried out after the passing of the  Data Protection Act of 2007, brings to the forefront two important questions on the ethics of information. 1) In what capacity should governments be permitted to collect SIGINT from public and private technological infrastructure. 2) Is there a right to privacy through deployment of ciphering and obfuscation of communication. The term digital liberties seems to intuit the content of the ethical domain these questions concern.

  The fallout has still not played itself out. There is still much uncertainty regarding the excent of coroporate involvement, and breaches of privacy of citizens of foreign countries which route much of their internet traffic through US servers. While the dust settles the concept of digital liberties can be examined through the lens of traditional ethics. To that end, I will provide a utilitarian argument that favours the inclution of the right to privacy and anonymity in the domain of digital liberties.

  Concider the availability of secure encryption. Is it unlawful not to hand over your private passwords when ordered by a court to do so? Should there exist a "master key" that renderes all ciphers plaintext? There have been rumours of deliberate exploitable weaknessess introduced in encryption algorithms since the dawn of public/private key encryption. It would seem unwise for any government to export a method of cryptography that they themselves would not be able to decrypt. While this practice might have been possible in the beginning, it seems unlikely it would continue to go unnoticed by independent auditors. Though, due to the incredible narrow set of people able to conduct cryptographic research on such a level, it's not impossible. More probable is that known methods of guesswork and pre-computation of keys are taken place on a much larger scale than available to the public. For instance, what are the chances of someone finding out the passord to your email if they tried every single combination of words in every word stored on your harddrive? This, and other methods are practiced by digital forensics workers every day.

  What if the keys used, say, to encrypt a chat conversation, was generated by an algorithm and never revealed to you. And let the method of private key generation be something akin to the Diffie-Hellman method. You talk with your friend and when the conversation ends, so does the keys. Barring an immediate raid by someone equiped to extract volotile data from a system, neither you nor your friend knows the password that unlocks the content of your conversation. There are both immediate gains and threats from that being available. It also exists today, in several forms.

  The continued existence of digital liberties that grant such rights as anonymity and privcy are, if we apply a utilitarian argument, necessary for the continued betterment of mankind.  We grant the harm principle as the lone axiom by which conduct will be judged moraly. It's worth repeating how Mill defends the right to free speech and publication by the same token. He rejects silencing of expression as progress is contingent on free public debate and speech, and further states that empirical evidence show that at no time have we ever "got it right" enough that we could have been justified in limiting speech (Mill, On Liberty,p77). The utility of such rights, are always for the good of all, they are the main ingredient of the evolution of the human soul.

  Does the same argument hold for the rights of privacy and anonymity? It cannot be denied that today, tools that provide shelter from government interference with freedom of information are deployed by those today fighting for freedom and justice in the Middle East and elsewhere. It has made possible the existence of services such as diverse as Wikileaks and Online Banking. Though quantum cryptography rears its shadow from research labs and underground bunkers, we have today available means of secure digital storage and communication. If claims that systems such as PRISM have been crucial in uncovering and foilng terrorist plots are measured against the total utility of digital liberties that include the rights mentioned, its hard to deny that the latter seems to have most utility for the most people.
</p>

<p>
  There seems then that liberties granted to us as citizens in the age of information should include that of both anonymity and privacy. If we accept this conclution it is evident that PRISM along with data retention laws being passed throughout the rest of the world are unethical.
